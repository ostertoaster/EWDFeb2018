# Enterprise Web Developer 2018

Thank you for your time in interviewing as a finalist for the Enterprise Web Developer Position. Bellow are two coding tasks we'd like you to complete and submit prior to your interview. A few notes:
* It's important to note that this is not a test. We want to get an idea for how you write code and solve problems. 
* We will be reviewing your submissions with you, so be prepared to discuss the steps you took to arrive at your solution.
* This is NOT closed book--use whatever resources you need. It's what we'd expect of you on the job.
* Get us your code however you prefer--the one caveat is that our email system won't accept files with the .zip extension.

## Task #1 - Reversal

Using your language of choice, write a function that will reverse a given string without using a built-in "reverse" function.

## Task #2 - Leave Plan

Write a working UI using HTML, CSS and JavaScript using the JSON data and wireframe in this repository. The wireframe is your guide for how this should be laid out. A couple other points:
* Use CSS to style your interface
* The data displayed should change when the month drop-down is changed
* The drop-down should be sorted in descending date order
* The most recent month should be the default view
* Preferred: Vacation should always be displayed before Sick

__Good luck!__
